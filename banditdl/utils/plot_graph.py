"""Render a 2D weighted graph of the worker network from a saved run.

Two edge-weight modes:

- `sampler_probability`: uses the final round of `sampler_probabilities.npy`
  or legacy `sampler_probabilities_final.npy`, the per-worker sampler
  distribution. This is **directional**: entry `P[i, j]` is worker `i`'s
  converged bandit probability of sampling worker `j`. The graph is therefore
  drawn as a directed graph with two opposite edges between each pair — edge
  `i -> j` carries `P[i, j]` and edge `j -> i` carries `P[j, i]`, one per node's
  own bandit.
- `neighbor_disagreement`: uses `pairwise_model_distance_final.npy` or
  `pairwise_model_distance_final_by_seed.npy`. Edge weight is `1 / (1 + dist)`
  so closer (more agreeing) workers get heavier edges — matching the bandit
  reward semantics. Model distance is symmetric, so this mode stays an
  undirected graph.

Pass `threshold` to keep only edges whose weight exceeds it (e.g. drop the
near-uniform exploration edges of an epsilon-greedy sampler), and/or
`top_edges_per_node` to keep only each node's strongest outgoing edges.

For clustered pathological partitions, nodes are colored by cluster and laid
out on concentric clusters; otherwise a spring layout is used.
