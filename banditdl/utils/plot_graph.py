"""Render a 2D weighted graph of the worker network from a saved run.

Two edge-weight modes:

- `sampler_probability`: uses `sampler_probabilities_final.npy`, the per-worker
  final-round sampler distribution. This is **directional**: entry `P[i, j]` is
  worker `i`'s converged bandit probability of sampling worker `j`. The graph is
  therefore drawn as a directed graph with two opposite edges between each pair —
  edge `i -> j` carries `P[i, j]` and edge `j -> i` carries `P[j, i]`, one per
  node's own bandit.
- `neighbor_disagreement`: uses `pairwise_model_distance_final.npy`. Edge weight
  is `1 / (1 + dist)` so closer (more agreeing) workers get heavier edges —
  matching the bandit reward semantics. Model distance is symmetric, so this mode
  stays an undirected graph.

Pass `threshold` to keep only edges whose weight exceeds it (e.g. drop the
near-uniform exploration edges of an epsilon-greedy sampler), and/or
`top_edges_per_node` to keep only each node's strongest outgoing edges.

When the run's heterogeneity is `grouped_classes`, nodes are colored by group
and laid out on concentric clusters; otherwise a spring layout is used.
